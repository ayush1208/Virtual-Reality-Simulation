# Virtual-Reality-Simulation
This is a Virtual Reality Simulation of objects such as planes,humans,buildings,etc.

In this we can control the human to move in all four directions and we can control the outlook of the scene(lights,camera).

We have 2 modes of cameras , one is the bird eye view and the other is the human view. We can switch between this views anytime we want.

We can also make our avatar sit on one of the planes and move along with the plane.

Few Screenshots and a Demo Video has been added.
